A concise guide to how I think, how I operate, and what I’ve actually done.

## 1. My Working Style

### Hypothesis-first, always

I start with hypotheses before I touch data.
Then I use SQL, funnels, session replays, interviews, and whatever signals I can get to figure out which hypotheses actually matter.
This keeps me focused on solving the right problem instead of reacting to noise.


### Deep dives are my default

I get obsessive about understanding problems.
I like pattern-matching across:
* conversation histories
* funnel analysis
* session replays
* heatmaps
* sales calls
* customer interviews

That combination helps me isolate the real decision-making drivers behind user behavior.


### Empathy as a practical tool

I really value empathy.

It helps me:
* build trust quickly
* understand different perspectives
* communicate clearly to different audiences
* tell stories that help people align
* change my mind when someone else has the better argument

I genuinely enjoy working with people and thinking from their point of view.


## 2. What I’ve Done
### Moveworks — Redesigned the Self-Serve Demo

This was a conversational AI product. I rebuilt the demo experience by:
* digging through conversation logs
* running funnel analyses in SQL
* watching session replays
* reviewing heatmaps
* studying sales rep conversations
* interviewing customers

I identified which value propositions actually shaped customer decisions, and what the old demo failed to communicate.
Worked with design to create a version that presented these value props intuitively and encouraged prospects to convert into paying customers.

Why it matters:
This is exactly how I think: dive deep, synthesize messy qualitative + quantitative inputs, isolate what users actually need, and reshape the product around that.

### Microsoft 365 — Defined MVP for the App Platform + Ran Growth Reviews

I talked to both ends of the ecosystem:
* end users → to learn where cross-app workflows were breaking
* app developers → to learn what they wanted to build and what was realistic

When we launched the App Store to Beta:
* I ran ongoing SQL funnel analyses
* I did weekly/biweekly growth reviews
* I used interviews to test hypotheses behind drop-offs

What I found:
* users didn’t understand why apps in Microsoft 365 were valuable
* they also weren’t seeing the indie apps they used every day
* after exploring the store, users dropped off because onboarding into the app’s value wasn’t clear

What I pushed for:
* spotlighting certain apps
* adding tutorials to app submissions so developers could teach their value upfront
And to help developer adoption:
* collaborated with engineering to create templated apps, because smaller dev teams said the SDK was built for large organizations and they didn’t have time for that.

Goal: improve Beta performance to beat targets before going GA.

### Microsoft Bing — Built a Data Pipeline + Analysis Dashboard

I built:
* a data pipeline
* a SQL-based dashboard to flag misunderstood queries

This surfaced the biggest opportunity areas for improving Bing’s query understanding system.
Then I used SQL again to collect and curate training data for AI model improvements.

Why it matters:
I’m comfortable getting hands-on with data systems, and I use data as a prioritization engine.

## 3. How This Maps to PostHog (and why I think I fit)
I already work the way PostHog expects PMs to work
* hypothesis first
* data as a decision tool
* user interviews as a normal weekly practice
* fast iteration
* exploration before solutioning
* clear communication

I enjoy the kind of product problems PostHog works on.
PostHog is all about:
* understanding behavior
* extracting insight
* translating insight into product value
* using real data to drive growth
This is exactly the loop I ran at Moveworks and Microsoft 365.

My strengths align with your culture
* deep curiosity
* self-serve data ability (SQL-heavy background)
* strong product taste shaped by actual customer insights
* empathy for both users and teammates
* collaborative, not territorial
* direct, clear communicator
* independent and autonomous
